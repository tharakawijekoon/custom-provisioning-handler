# custom-provisioning-handler

When JIT provisioning users, Identity Server will generate a random password when adding a user to the user store as it is mandatory to have a password in the user store manager level. According to the logic[1], the generated password is a random string whose length is 12. So if you have a password policy or regex rejecting the internally generated password it will cause an error when the user is added. 

The steps to resolve this issue is documentated[2]. (Please refer the JIT Provisioning section). A custom provisioning handler needs to be implemented
. This repository has has a simple custom provisioning handler which generates a random password.

# Build, Deploy & Run

## Build
Clone the repository, change directory into it and execute the following command to build the project

```mvn clean install```

## Deploy

Copy and place the built JAR artifact from the /target/org.wso2.custom.handlers.password.provisioning-1.0.0.jar to the <IS_HOME>/repository/components/lib directory.(the built JAR artifact can be found in the releases section)

Navigate to <IS_HOME>/repository/conf/deployment.toml and add the following configuration.

```
[authentication.framework.extensions] 
provisioning_handler="org.wso2.custom.handlers.password.provisioning.CustomProvisioningHandler"
```

## Run

Restart the server and test the JIT provisioning flow.
